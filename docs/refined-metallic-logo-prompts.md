# Refined Metallic Logo Prompts - AIDE Brasil

## Core Concept
Flower-brain hybrid logo with 8 symmetrical petals surrounding a split brain design

## Master Prompt - Ultra Metallic Version

```text
Design a premium logo: stylized brain split vertically, surrounded by 8 geometric flower petals in perfect radial symmetry. 

Visual style:
- METALLIC CHROME EFFECT with high polish finish
- Brazilian gradient: forest green (#065f46) to bright emerald (#10b981) on left, emerald (#34d399) to gold (#fbbf24) on right
- Gradient should look like polished metal, not flat colors
- Add subtle light reflections as if lit from above
- Brain grooves: simple flowing curves, 3-4 lines per hemisphere
- Petals: sharp, geometric shapes like cut gems or crystals
- Line weight: 3px for main outlines, 2px for details
- Dark background (#0a0a0a)

Quality: Ultra high definition, premium tech company logo aesthetic similar to Apple or Tesla logos. The metal should appear lustrous and three-dimensional without being overly complex.
```

## Variation 1: Minimalist Geometric

```text
Minimalist logo design: geometric brain icon with 8 triangular petals forming a mandala pattern.

Requirements:
- EXTREME SIMPLIFICATION - reduce brain to 2-3 curved lines per side
- Petals: perfect triangles or diamond shapes
- Brazilian metallic gradient flowing continuously from green to gold
- Thin lines only (2px maximum)
- Negative space is important - lots of breathing room
- Style reference: Instagram or Spotify logo simplicity
- Metallic effect through gradient only, no textures
- Perfect symmetry and mathematical precision
```

## Variation 2: Line Art Metallic

```text
Pure line art logo: brain and flower petals defined only by metallic gradient outlines, no fills.

Specifications:
- OUTLINE ONLY design - completely hollow
- Stroke width: 2.5px with metallic gradient applied to the stroke
- Brazilian colors: gradient flows through the line itself
- Brain: two curved lines suggesting hemispheres
- Petals: 8 curved strokes forming flower shape
- Where lines intersect, they should weave over/under for depth
- Dark background to make metallic lines pop
- Reference: Modern fintech or blockchain logos
```

## Variation 3: Liquid Metal Effect

```text
Organic logo with liquid metal appearance: brain and petals look like flowing mercury with Brazilian colors.

Design elements:
- LIQUID METAL texture - smooth, flowing, reflective
- Gradient appears to shift and flow within the shape
- Soft edges, organic curves (no sharp corners)
- Brain grooves blend smoothly into surface
- Petals have teardrop or leaf-like organic shapes
- Subtle highlights suggesting wet metal surface
- Gradient: deep green flowing into gold like oil on water
- Premium, futuristic aesthetic
```

## Variation 4: Faceted Crystal

```text
Geometric crystal logo: brain and petals designed as faceted gems with metallic finish.

Structure:
- FACETED/POLYGONAL style - like a cut diamond
- Each surface catches light differently
- Brazilian gradient shifts across facets
- Brain: angular, low-poly interpretation
- Petals: geometric shards radiating outward
- Sharp, clean edges with metallic highlights
- Each facet has subtle gradient variation
- Reference: Ethereum logo geometric style
```

## Variation 5: Brushed Metal Industrial

```text
Industrial design logo: brain and petals with brushed aluminum texture and Brazilian gradient overlay.

Texture details:
- BRUSHED METAL finish with visible horizontal grain
- Matte metallic rather than high gloss
- Gradient subtle and sophisticated
- Brain: embossed/debossed effect
- Petals: look machined from metal
- Subtle shadows for depth
- Industrial, engineering aesthetic
- Reference: Tesla or SpaceX logo finish
```

## Key Improvements for All Versions

1. **Metallic Quality**: Must look like actual metal, not just colored shapes
2. **Gradient Flow**: Smooth transition from green through emerald to gold
3. **Simplification**: Reduce complexity while maintaining recognition
4. **Symmetry**: Perfect radial balance is essential
5. **Modern Feel**: Clean, professional, tech-forward
6. **Brazilian Identity**: Colors should immediately evoke Brazil
7. **Scalability**: Must work from 16px favicon to billboard size

## Specific Color Instructions

```text
CRITICAL - Exact gradient stops:
0%: #065f46 (deep forest green)
33%: #10b981 (emerald)
66%: #34d399 (light emerald)
100%: #fbbf24 (Brazilian gold)

Apply as radial gradient from center OR linear gradient from left to right.
Colors should have metallic sheen overlay for premium feel.
```

## What to Avoid

- Overly complex brain anatomy
- Too many small details
- Flat, non-metallic appearance
- Muddy color transitions
- Asymmetrical elements
- Cartoonish or playful style
- Excessive gradients or effects

## Testing the Logo

The final logo should:
- Look premium at 60px (header size)
- Be recognizable at 16px (favicon)
- Work on both dark and light backgrounds
- Animate well (slow rotation for loading states)
- Feel cohesive with modern tech brands
