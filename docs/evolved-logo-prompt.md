# Evolved Metallic Logo Prompt - AIDE Brasil

## Final Logo Evolution Prompt

```
Create a modern, sleek logo featuring a brain merged with flower petals in a symmetrical design. The brain should be split vertically down the middle with clean geometric lines. Surrounding the brain, 8 flower petals arranged in a circular pattern, creating a blooming effect.

Apply a premium metallic gradient:
- Left side: Deep forest green (#065f46) transitioning to emerald (#10b981)
- Right side: Bright emerald (#34d399) transitioning to Brazilian gold (#fbbf24)
- Petals should follow the same gradient flow from green to gold clockwise

Style requirements:
- Ultra-clean vector design with thin, elegant lines (2px max)
- Metallic sheen effect with subtle highlights
- Dark background (#0a0a0a) 
- Minimalist approach - no texture, just smooth gradients
- Professional tech aesthetic like Claude or ChatGPT logos
- Each petal should have a subtle 3D depth with metallic edge
- Brain grooves simplified to flowing curves, not realistic
- Overall shape fits within a perfect circle
- Suitable for app icon, favicon, and header logo

The design should feel premium, modern, and convey AI innovation with Brazilian identity through the green-to-gold metallic gradient. The flower-brain fusion represents growth, intelligence, and natural evolution of AI.

## Variations to Request

### Version 1: Pure Metallic
```
Same design but with enhanced metallic effect - add subtle reflection lines across the surface, similar to brushed metal finish. Gradient should have a lustrous, almost chrome-like quality.
```

### Version 2: Minimal Line Art
```
Same design but as pure line art - no fills, just the outlines with gradient stroke. Brain and petals defined only by their contours. Line weight: 2.5px with metallic gradient applied to the stroke itself.
```

### Version 3: Glassmorphic
```
Same design but with glass morphism effect - semi-transparent brain and petals with frosted glass appearance. Metallic gradient at 80% opacity with blur effect on edges. Subtle inner glow.
```

## Usage Context

This logo will be used:
- Website header (60px height)
- App icon (rounded square)
- Favicon (16x16)
- Social media profiles
- Marketing materials
- Loading animations (rotating slowly)

The metallic effect should be subtle enough to work at all sizes while maintaining the premium feel that matches the website's aesthetic.
